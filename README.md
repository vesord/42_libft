C static library with some rewrited libc functions and some my useful functions.

Poject was made due to my studying in 21-school, Russia.

The **main goal** of project is learn how to use `static` functions in C, and also make a lib which I can use in my futher (school) projects.

## Usage

Run `make` to compile the `libft.a` library.

You can check list of functions in [`libft.h`](libft.h "libft.a functions list") file.
